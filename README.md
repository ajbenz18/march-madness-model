The question my project aims to answer is: Can I build models to determine what kind of teams make it furthest in the tournament and can I use these models to build an accurate and predictive bracket.

## How to run the notebook

All analysis is contained in analysis.ipynb and it uses files contained in this repository. It can be run as is as long as all requirements are installed. 

The other .ipynb file, cleaning.ipynb processes, cleans, and merges the raw data into the usable, parsable data. This file does not need to be run as the parsable data is already present in the repository.
